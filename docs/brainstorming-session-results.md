## Executive Summary

**Topic:** AI-driven text adventure game with dynamic world generation

**Session Goals:** Explore and refine the concept of an AI-powered narrative adventure game that generates completely unique storylines, worlds, and characters for each playthrough - delivering D&D-depth storytelling with text-adventure simplicity.

**Techniques Used:** What If Scenarios, SCAMPER (Substitute), Five Whys, Progressive Refinement

**Total Ideas Generated:** 25+ concepts across world-building, narrative systems, player roles, and technical architecture

### Key Themes Identified:
- AI prompt engineering is the core technical challenge, not content variety
- Multiple themes from launch (not just one) since it's about template variation
- Each playthrough generates a completely unique world with its own rules, magic, cultures
- Rich D&D-style storytelling without mechanical complexity (no stats, dice, inventory)
- User-provided API keys for AI access
- Web-based for maximum accessibility

---

## Technique Sessions

### What If Scenarios - 15 minutes

**Description:** Provocative questions to explore possibilities and unlock creative thinking about the game concept.

**Ideas Generated:**

1. Theme personality variants - AI adapts narrative voice and style (Terry Pratchett humor with footnotes, Lovecraftian purple prose, noir detective hard-boiled narration)
2. Beyond just content, the narration style itself changes with theme personality
3. Personality could affect character dialogue, choice presentation, and world descriptions
4. Multiple theme options from the start rather than limiting to one for MVP

**Insights Discovered:**
- The game could offer variety not just in content but in how stories are told
- Different narrative voices create distinct experiences even within the same genre
- Theme variants (dark vs humorous fantasy) are valuable post-MVP features

**Notable Connections:**
- Connecting narrative voice to theme opens up rich possibilities for player preferences
- The way choices are presented could enhance the theme (sarcastic options in Pratchett mode)

---

### SCAMPER Method (Substitute) - 20 minutes

**Description:** Exploring what could be substituted in traditional text adventures to create something innovative.

**Ideas Generated:**

1. **Player role substitution** - Instead of always being "the hero," each playthrough assigns unique perspectives:
   - The castle's spirit (bound to protect, can influence through whispers and environment)
   - A dragon's shadow (incorporeal vengeance, tempting mortals)
   - The apprentice's familiar (gaining intelligence, struggling with magical bonds)

2. **Story progression substitution** - Non-linear, wildly branching narratives powered by AI flexibility

3. **World persistence substitution** - Instead of one static world, generate completely new worlds each playthrough

**Insights Discovered:**
- Unique player roles create built-in dramatic tension through limitations and goals
- The same fantasy setting experienced through different lenses multiplies replay value
- AI enables perspective-based gameplay that would be impossible to pre-write

**Notable Connections:**
- Player roles naturally suggest different abilities, limitations, and narrative possibilities
- Each role implies different game mechanics emerging from story, not from stats
- The "who you are" becomes as important as "what world you're in"

### Progressive Refinement - 25 minutes

**Description:** Iterative questioning to clarify and refine the core vision, moving from broad concept to specific implementation decisions.

**Ideas Generated:**

1. **Simplified MVP approach** - Web app (not desktop) for fastest development and widest accessibility

2. **Core technical challenge identified** - AI prompt engineering and coherence management, not theme variety

3. **Theme selection for MVP** - Fantasy, Cyberpunk, Steampunk (user's personal favorites for testing/iteration)

4. **AI provider choice** - OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for easiest start (simple API, good documentation, cost-effective)

5. **MVP scope clarity** - User inputs API key → Selects theme → AI generates unique world → Story unfolds through choices

6. **World generation approach** - Even within "Fantasy," each playthrough creates totally different worlds (volcanic empires, floating islands, underground kingdoms)

**Insights Discovered:**
- The project is fundamentally about controlling AI output, not creating content libraries
- Multiple themes from launch doesn't significantly increase complexity
- Web app offers faster iteration cycle than desktop development
- User passion for exploration and variety should drive design decisions

**Notable Connections:**
- User's love of world-building aligns perfectly with AI's generative strengths
- The D&D comparison clarified "depth of storytelling without mechanical overhead"
- Starting with themes the developer enjoys ensures sustained motivation during development

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Nail the AI Prompt Engineering

- **Rationale:** This is the foundational technical challenge. Everything else - themes, UI, features - depends on successfully generating coherent, engaging, unique content through AI prompts. Must prove this works before building extensive features.

- **Next steps:**
  1. Set up OpenAI API account and get test API key
  2. Build simple Node.js or Python script to experiment with world generation prompts
  3. Test prompt variations for Fantasy theme first (world building, character creation, story progression)
  4. Evaluate: Is each world genuinely unique? Is story coherent across multiple AI responses? Are choices meaningful?
  5. Document what works and create reusable prompt templates
  6. Expand to Cyberpunk and Steampunk once Fantasy prompts are solid

- **Resources needed:**
  - OpenAI API access (free tier sufficient for testing)
  - Basic programming environment (Node.js/Python)
  - Time for iteration and testing (estimate 1-2 weeks of experimentation)

- **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks of focused prompt engineering before UI development

---

#### #2 Priority: Define MVP Theme Prompt Templates

- **Rationale:** With 3 launch themes (Fantasy, Cyberpunk, Steampunk), need distinct prompt templates that generate theme-appropriate worlds while maintaining quality and uniqueness. This validates that the AI orchestration works across different genres.

- **Next steps:**
  1. Create base prompt template structure (world generation, story start, choice handling, narrative progression)
  2. Adapt template for Fantasy theme with genre-specific elements (magic systems, medieval settings, classic tropes)
  3. Adapt template for Cyberpunk (neon cities, corporate dystopia, hacking, AI themes)
  4. Adapt template for Steampunk (Victorian era, clockwork technology, industrial revolution aesthetics)
  5. Test each template for quality and uniqueness across multiple generations
  6. Refine based on output quality

- **Resources needed:**
  - Completed Priority #1 (understanding what makes good prompts)
  - Genre knowledge for each theme
  - Testing time to ensure quality across all themes

- **Timeline:** 1 week after Priority #1 completion

---

#### #3 Priority: Build Simple, Functional Web App MVP

- **Rationale:** Players need an accessible interface to experience the game. Web app provides fastest path to testing the complete gameplay loop without platform constraints.

- **Next steps:**
  1. Choose tech stack (vanilla HTML/CSS/JS or framework like React/Vue)
  2. Design basic user flow wireframe: API key entry → Theme selection → Story display → Choice buttons → Continue story
  3. Build core interface components (API key input with secure storage, theme selector, story text area, choice buttons)
  4. Integrate OpenAI API with error handling
  5. Implement basic game loop (display AI response, collect choice, send to AI, repeat)
  6. Add minimal styling for readability
  7. Test complete flow end-to-end
  8. Deploy to free hosting (Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages)

- **Resources needed:**
  - Web development skills (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
  - Free hosting service account
  - Completed Priority #1 and #2 (working prompt templates)

- **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks after prompt templates are ready

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well

- Progressive refinement technique helped clarify from vague concept to concrete MVP plan
- Challenging assumptions (e.g., "Does Fantasy-only MVP make sense?") led to better decisions
- User's creative role examples (castle spirit, dragon's shadow) demonstrated deep engagement
- Connecting to D&D analogy crystallized the "depth without complexity" vision
- Focusing on what excites the developer personally (multiple themes, exploration) ensures sustainable motivation

### Areas for Further Exploration

- **AI coherence strategies**: How to maintain story consistency across 10+ AI interactions? Should we use conversation history, world state summaries, or other techniques?
- **Choice quality**: What makes choices feel meaningful vs superficial? How to ensure AI generates impactful decision points?
- **Pacing and story structure**: How to guide AI toward satisfying narrative arcs without making stories feel formulaic?
- **Player agency vs AI creativity**: Balance between player control and AI surprise - where's the sweet spot?
- **Testing at scale**: How to validate that worlds truly feel unique after 50+ playthroughs?

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

- **Morphological Analysis**: For designing the prompt template structure - break down all components (world elements, story beats, choice types) and explore combinations
- **Assumption Reversal**: Challenge core assumptions about text adventures (e.g., "What if choices don't branch the story but reveal different perspectives on the same events?")
- **Provocation Technique**: Use provocative statements to generate innovative features (e.g., "PO: The AI is a hostile dungeon master trying to kill the player")
- **Question Storming**: Generate 50+ questions about player experience, AI behavior, and technical implementation before building

### Questions That Emerged

- How many AI interactions should constitute a "complete" playthrough? (10? 20? Player decides when to end?)
- Should there be win/lose states, or is it pure narrative exploration?
- How to handle API costs for users - should there be usage estimates/warnings?
- What happens if API call fails mid-story? Graceful degradation strategy?
- Should players be able to "rewind" choices, or are decisions permanent?
- How to prevent AI from generating inappropriate/offensive content?
- Could the app work offline with local AI models (Ollama) for users without API keys?
- Should there be community features (share stories, worlds, or just keep it solo)?

### Next Session Planning

- **Suggested topics:**
  1. Technical architecture deep-dive (API integration patterns, state management, error handling)
  2. User experience design (onboarding flow, first-time user guidance, choice presentation)
  3. Prompt engineering workshop (hands-on testing and iteration of world generation prompts)
  4. Post-MVP roadmap (prioritizing theme variants, save systems, unique roles, etc.)

- **Recommended timeframe:** After completing MVP priorities 1-2 (prompt engineering and templates), schedule next session to tackle Priority 3 (UI) in detail

- **Preparation needed:**
  - Complete initial prompt engineering experiments
  - Document what works/doesn't work with different prompt structures
  - Gather 5-10 example AI-generated worlds to evaluate quality
  - Sketch rough UI wireframes or mockups to discuss
