# Example outputs for reference
examples:
  opening_example:
    narrative: |
      The emotion crystal erupts from the plaza floor with a sound like shattering glass played backwards. You stumble back as jagged formations of crystallized rage thrust upward, their surfaces burning with an inner fire that makes your skin prickle. Around you, citizens of the Numbed city scatter in their characteristic silent panic - no screams, no shouts, just the efficient evacuation of people who've trained themselves not to feel.

      But you feel. You feel the heat, the fear, the anger radiating from the crystal. And worse - you recognize the emotional signature. This rage belongs to someone you know, someone who was supposed to have undergone the Numbing procedure three days ago.

      The crystal grows higher, cracks spider-webbing across the plaza's pristine white stone. Through its translucent surface, you can see something moving inside. A figure. Your sister.
    choices:
      - id: "choice_1"
        text: "Try to communicate with your sister through the crystal using your untrained emotional resonance"
        approach: "magic"
      - id: "choice_2"
        text: "Search for the Numbed authorities to help extract her before the crystal hardens completely"
        approach: "diplomacy"
      - id: "choice_3"
        text: "Use a nearby harvesting tool to carefully chip away at the crystal's surface"
        approach: "investigation"

  continuation_example:
    narrative: |
      You press your palm against the burning surface of the rage crystal, wincing as the heat sears your skin. But you push past the pain and reach inward, searching for the untrained spark of emotional magic you've always kept hidden. The crystal responds immediately - a pulse of recognition that sends tremors through the entire structure.

      Your sister's voice echoes through the crystalline prison, distorted but unmistakable: "They tried to take it from me. They tried to take everything." Images flood your mind: the Numbing facility, the cold instruments, her desperate resistance. She didn't run from the procedure - she was taken by force.

      The crystal's growth accelerates, feeding on the fury now flowing between you both. Above, you hear the mechanical whir of harvesting drones descending. The Numbed won't let this crystal continue growing in their city center. They'll extract it - and your sister with it - unless you act now.
    choices:
      - id: "choice_1"
        text: "Channel your own emotions into the crystal to help your sister break free from inside"
        approach: "magic"
      - id: "choice_2"
        text: "Reason with the approaching Numbed authorities about the forced procedure"
        approach: "diplomacy"
      - id: "choice_3"
        text: "Create a distraction to buy time while you figure out how to safely extract her"
        approach: "stealth"
      - id: "choice_4"
        text: "Confront the drones physically to prevent them from reaching the crystal"
        approach: "combat"
