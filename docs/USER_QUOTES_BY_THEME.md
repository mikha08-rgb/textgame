# User Quotes & Feedback - Organized by Theme

**Source:** Competitive analysis of AI worldbuilding and creative writing tools (October 2025)
**Purpose:** Real user voices to guide product decisions and marketing messaging

---

## 1. Generic Output (Top Complaint)

### The Core Problem

> "AI can only put together the most statistically likely words and phrases to create what you ask of it. In other words, it can only output clichés that are too general, too bland."

> "AI output tends to be 'generic and lackluster' because large language models 'look at words and try to guess what a human would say next.'"

> "AI-generated posts are verbose, meandering, and devoid of real substance with excessive hedging that presents every argument with an opposing one, wrapped in so much 'on the one hand' and 'on the other' that they end up saying nothing at all."

### Specific Patterns

> "Lists of 'ChatGPT words to avoid' circulate in web publishing communities, and advice on how not to sound like a chatbot abounds on LinkedIn, TikTok, and Reddit."

> "Em dashes are 'baked into' AI's training data and appear 'absolutely everywhere' because 'humans used them so often that AIs learned them as a default natural flow.'"

> "ChatGPT loves dance metaphors, with everything being an 'intricate and delicate dance between x and y'."

### Impact on Writers

> "I am not sure what point exactly are they trying to make... there seems to be a general topic they write about, but they just write their associations with the topic, instead of focusing on what is really important."

> "AI tends to write in a very formal, neutral tone, lacking the quirks, humor, and personality that make human writing impressive."

> "Some editors decline pieces because they're flagged as AI-generated, even when writers have written all words themselves."

**Product Implication:** Constitutional AI cliché detection is a major differentiator

---

## 2. Memory & Consistency Issues

### The Degradation Problem

> "Without this application there is no way to keep the AI on track with my story. AI keeps creating content that makes no sense and that I have to keep editing out."

> "Even long-time users admit the cracks are showing, with common complaints about how quickly the AI starts to forget its own plotlines and the memory system lagging behind other tools." (NovelAI)

> "Pretty good story script, but there is a lot of repetition, both of what was written, and what's come before. Doesn't progress the plot thread on it's own." (Deep Realms)

### Manual Workarounds

> "Users need to meticulously copy-paste their lore into each new prompt or use third-party tools to manage their world bible."

> "Consistency is identified as a major challenge for AI worldbuilding tools, as the AI's context window is limited."

### Real-World Failures

> "Healthcare assistants fail to maintain consistent understanding of patient history across multiple consultations, potentially missing important patterns."

> "Research assistants cannot effectively build on previously established findings, requiring users to manually maintain research continuity."

### What Works (Praise)

> "The Lorebook was the standout feature—users could create entries for characters, places, and even rules of magic, and NovelAI automatically weaved them into the story when relevant." (NovelAI)

> "When setting up a character named 'Amaka,' who was a botanist with a fear of rivers, the AI remembered her quirks and incorporated them later without prompting. That kind of consistency is gold for long projects." (NovelAI)

**Product Implication:** Smart RAG + Constitutional AI addresses this better than competitors

---

## 3. Control vs. Automation

### Frustration with AI "Taking Over"

> "Things started to fall apart and they had some seriously frustrating moments trying to get ChatGPT to stay on task."

> "AI often learns the wrong thing and in ChatGPT specifically, it will often fixate on something despite or even because of corrections."

> "AI writing tools are impressive but require active collaboration, as left to their own devices, they tend to produce fairly generic and frequently incorrect content."

### What Users Actually Want

> "Users want more control over text output - including options to influence tone, style, language, and content, with tools they can collaborate with rather than just letting AI do everything."

> "The best AI writing tools should let users set a default brand voice and create a knowledge base to use as a source of truth."

> "Tools prioritizing customization and control allow users to fine-tune the AI's output, set stylistic preferences, and guide the generation process with precision."

### Collaborative Success

> "To reduce the likelihood of fabrications in AI systems, one good practice is to enable users to guide the copilot toward their personal goals and objectives in what is called collaborative UX."

> "Meaningful human controls enable users to confidently and iteratively guide the copilot towards their goals."

**Product Implication:** Chat-based iterative refinement > one-shot generation

---

## 4. Learning Curve & Complexity

### World Anvil Pain

> "The extensive functionalities may be overwhelming and the learning curve might deter those seeking a straightforward solution."

> "Just about any time you want to try a feature, you'll probably need to consult reference material."

> "The usability of the software receives criticism for being unintuitive and outdated. The text editor feels stuck in the 2000s."

### General Pattern

> "Campfire Pro and Blaze sit below Scrivener in terms of learning curve, but stand above most everything else on the market. Neither one is particularly easy to use, and unless your imagination is wild, I can't imagine you jumping in without feeling a little overwhelmed by their available options."

> "Obsidian has a very difficult learning curve, especially for non-programmers, and is difficult to collaborate as a team."

### What Works Better

> "Sudowrite is described as 'super easy to use, allowing users to get started in minutes while also providing options for detailed content generation requests.'"

> "The brainstorming features are extensive enough that users report they won't have problems coming up with ideas again." (Sudowrite)

**Product Implication:** Chat UX provides low learning curve while maintaining power

---

## 5. Subscription & Pricing Complaints

### Fatigue & Hidden Costs

> "Monthly costs can add up quickly, and most users don't use every feature every month; experts recommend being clear about specific tasks needed and picking the best fit rather than subscribing to multiple tools."

> "Significant concerns arise regarding automatic subscription renewals and the lack of refund policies." (World Anvil)

> "Some users complain about automatic subscription charges for a full year without warning or ability to refund. Some report that even after immediately contacting them following auto-renewal, they refuse refunds." (World Anvil)

### Value Comparisons

> "Campfire has the potential to become far more expensive than comparable writing apps: popular Scrivener, for example, which also offers many planning and brainstorming features, costs $59.99 to purchase forever (no subscriptions involved)."

> "Compared to other worldbuilding manuscript programs, this subscription format can actually become rather pricey, especially considering that Scrivener is only a one-time purchase." (Campfire)

> "When comparing the prices of Sudowrite and NovelAI, both seem to have their pros and cons depending on what you're looking for, with Sudowrite being more affordable for casual writers, while NovelAI could be a better value if you're planning to write a lot."

### What's Worth Paying For

> "ChatGPT Enterprise cut down research time by an average of an hour per day, and this kind of time-saving can quickly make up for the cost."

> "Perplexity Pro is absolutely worth the money if you can only pick one premium AI tool, with users replacing Google for many searches from in-depth research to how-tos."

> "[LegendKeeper's price is] a steal" at $9/month

**Product Implication:** BYOAK model addresses subscription fatigue directly

## 6. What Users Love (Positive Feedback)

### NovelAI Strengths

> "The Lorebook system assists fantasy and sci-fi creators who need help organizing complex story elements."

> "NovelAI remembers past story details to maintain continuity across chapters and narratives, and excels for writers needing depth, consistency, and creative freedom across long stories."

> "Direct dev-community communication via Discord and community feedback is taken directly into account. Users have noted that when they report issues, 'it gets fixed,' and when features are missing, 'it gets added.'"

> "For many players, the characters in their stories become almost like family, and the idea of moving to a new platform and bringing these characters to a sudden halt is as hard as saying goodbye to a loved one."

### Sudowrite Strengths

> "Brainstorm acts as an infinite 'yes, and' buddy that never runs out of ideas, and it learns from thumbs-up favorites to give better suggestions."

> "Sudowrite has genuinely impressive qualities in its ability to accurately summarize content, brainstorm and elaborate on details, and it's accessible and user-friendly."

> "One of the few AI tools specifically geared for fiction authors, and it's consistently recommended as one of the current best on the market for fiction."

### Claude Strengths

> "Claude tends to sound better in its natural language than GPT models, writes more naturally and conversationally, with casual tone and vocabulary that mirror human speech effectively."

> "Claude is better suited to tasks focused on the craft of writing—it's great at helping polish dry prose and has a knack for creative exercises, like dialogue and writing fiction."

> "Claude Opus 4.1 is pushing the frontier in creative writing, producing human-quality content with rich, deep character development and more natural, prose-focused outputs."

### Notion AI Strengths

> "Artificial intelligence becomes more useful when it's integrated across the place where you're already doing work, storing notes and docs, and collaborating with others, with no need to switch back and forth between notes and a separate AI-powered tool."

> "When you're editing a project proposal, Notion AI knows your company's formatting standards from other pages, and when you're summarizing meeting notes, it understands your team's typical action item formats, making this contextual awareness fundamentally different from generic AI tools."

### Character.AI Engagement

> "Character.AI users are highly engaged, spending an average of two hours daily on the platform."

> "Visitors to the Character AI website spend an impressive average of 17 minutes and 23 seconds exploring the platform, browsing an average of 9.86 pages per visit. This engagement time surpasses ChatGPT, hitting an average of 45 minutes per session versus 7 in OpenAI's generative AI."

> "Character.ai's usage held up over the summer months because the app is designed for entertainment, not as a homework helper or research assistant."

### LegendKeeper Praise

> "Reviewers have called the price 'a steal', and LegendKeeper has been praised as 'probably one of the best note map editors because it lets you decide what kind of note structure you need and provides the tools to do so.'"

> "Legendkeeper's smaller collection of robust features presents a more digestible system for less experienced users."

**Product Implication:** Integration, context awareness, and entertainment value drive retention

---

## 7. Feature Requests & Wishes

### What Users Explicitly Requested

> "A writing app that allows users to 'request a critique' from famous writers' personas, with models able to highlight passages and leave comments in the margins, and the ability to set different 'personas' to review content."

> "A minimalist ebook reader where users can highlight passages and have the model explain things in depth, with the model taking on the persona of the author, feeling like an extension of the book rather than a separate chat instance."

### Emerging Needs

> "39% of firms require writing support in three or more languages, representing a significant growth opportunity in multilingual content creation."

> "Untapped sectors such as legal tech, HR, and multilingual support for nonprofits represent significant whitespace opportunities."

### Iterative Workflows

> "Allowing users to make use of previous prompts is deeply valuable to the iterative process."

> "WorldSmith explores how creatives can leverage prompt-based generative AI beyond current 'click-once' prompting UI paradigms."

**Product Implication:** Iterative, collaborative features are underserved

## 8. Accuracy & Trust Issues

### The Hallucination Problem

> "AI sometimes 'hallucinates' by delivering confident but false information or making up website URLs, requiring users to fact-check everything."

> "42% of users have reported inaccuracies or off-context suggestions from AI Writing Assistant Software."

> "35% of healthcare and legal professionals express concerns about the software's inability to understand compliance or tone sensitivity."

### Risk Factors

> "The more technical the content or the greater the reliance on AI composition from scratch, the higher the risk of inaccurate statements." (Jasper)

## 10. Market Gaps (Inferred from Complaints)

### Visual + Text Integration

> "Most AI tools can handle text-based worldbuilding, some also generate visuals," suggesting this remains a differentiating feature.

> "NovelAI has both [text and images] but [is] anime-focused" - implying need for other styles

> "Sudowrite lacks visuals entirely" - clear gap

### Genre Specificity

> "The first image fell right into the AI stereotype trap and gave me a chisel-jawed white man as my astronaut." (Bias issues)

> "AI can serve as a 'digital lore-keeper,' ensuring your magic systems, geography, and timelines remain consistent." (Presented as ideal, not reality)

### Onboarding & UX

> "Onboarding that feels like a game instead of a tutorial" (Mentioned as opportunity)

> "Some competitors generate 'walls of text that no one will read'" (Common complaint)

### Offline & Mobile

> "Primarily an online platform, which might restrict usage in offline environments." (Deep Realms)

## 11. Business Model Insights

### Free Tier Success

> "If you're not ready or willing to pay for such a service, Kanka has the best free tier with the most features."

> "For straightforward writing needs like generating ideas, creating basic outlines, or drafting short, uncomplicated content, free AI tools typically perform adequately without requiring premium features."

### When Users Pay

> "Paid AI essay writers differentiate themselves through enhanced capabilities, advanced features, and specialized functionalities designed for serious writers, professionals, and academic users."

> "Premium tools are particularly valuable for writers who need specific premium features but not the full suite, teams sharing access who can distribute costs across multiple users, content creators experiencing seasonal or project-based demand spikes."

> "Most users don't use every feature every month; experts recommend being clear about specific tasks needed and picking the best fit rather than subscribing to multiple tools."

> "Recommendation: Pick ONE tool, use fully for a month rather than running multiple subscriptions at once."

**Product Implication:** Clear value proposition at each tier is essential

---

## 12. Success Patterns

### Emotional Investment

> "For many players, the characters in their stories become almost like family, and the idea of moving to a new platform and bringing these characters to a sudden halt is as hard as saying goodbye to a loved one. This emotional investment creates strong user retention." (NovelAI)

### Entertainment > Utility

> "Character.ai's usage held up over the summer months because the app is designed for entertainment, not as a homework helper or research assistant."

### Context Awareness

> "From a product standpoint, maintaining context had direct impact on user trust and engagement. Users could notice when the assistant remembers details across the chat, it made the experience feel more like a consistent, caring conversation rather than a series of disjointed replies."

**Product Implication:** Emotional connection, entertainment value, and context awareness drive loyalty
