# Prompt Research Session - Documentation

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Project:** AI Worldbuilding Engine (textgamea)
**Goal:** Research and improve worldbuilding prompts to eliminate clichés and tropes

---

## Problem Statement

Despite having extensive negative constraints (forbidden lists with 150+ lines), the worldbuilding prompts still produce clichéd fantasy outputs:

### Specific Issues:
1. **Conceptual clichés** - Structure/patterns are tropey even if specific words differ
2. **Semantic evasion** - AI uses synonyms to work around forbidden terms
3. **Genre defaults** - Falls back to standard fantasy tropes when unsure
4. **Insufficient novelty** - Outputs feel "safe" rather than genuinely creative
5. **Cliché persistence** - Similar patterns repeat across multiple generations

### Current Approach (Not Working Well Enough):
- **Extensive forbidden lists** including:
  - Faction patterns: "The [Adjective] [Noun]"
  - Endings: -ia, -or, -mancy, -ium
  - Terms: luminous, umbral, void, ethereal, ancient, eternal
  - Magic sources: memories, emotions, crystals, essence, mana
  - Conflict frames: light vs dark, order vs chaos, balance/imbalance
- **Domain fusion constraints** (e.g., "BREATH mechanizes LAW")
- **High temperature (0.95)** for creativity
- **5,450+ word comprehensive prompts** with detailed schemas
- **Pre-generation checklists**

### Key Research Questions:

**Must Answer:**
1. Why do negative constraint lists (forbidden lists) fail to prevent clichés in LLM outputs?
2. What prompt engineering techniques are proven to increase originality and reduce clichés?
3. How can you measure/detect clichés programmatically to validate improvements?
4. What are state-of-the-art techniques (2024-2025) for creative constraint satisfaction in LLMs?

**Nice to Have:**
5. Are there better models, parameters, or sampling strategies for original creative content?
6. How do successful creative AI tools (NovelAI, AI Dungeon) handle originality?
7. What techniques exist for maintaining consistency while increasing novelty?
