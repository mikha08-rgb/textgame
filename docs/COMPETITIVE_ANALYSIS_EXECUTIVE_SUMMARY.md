## Critical Market Gaps (Your Opportunities)

### Gap 1: Iterative Without Complexity
**Problem:** World Anvil = powerful but overwhelming; AI tools = easy but generic
**Opportunity:** Chat-based progressive generation, "feels like conversation"
**Target:** Authors who want depth without steep learning

### Gap 2: Memory That Works
**Problem:** All tools struggle with long-term consistency
**Opportunity:** Constitutional AI + RAG for true consistency

**Your Advantage:** Already implemented, no competitor has this

### Gap 5: Transparent Pricing
**Problem:** Subscription fatigue, auto-renewal complaints
**Opportunity:** BYOAK (Bring Your Own API Key) model
**Target:** Cost-conscious indies, hobbyists
