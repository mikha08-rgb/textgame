# Deploy Streaming Feature - Quick Guide

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

✅ Implementation complete
✅ Build succeeds (verified)
✅ All functions updated
✅ Error handling robust
✅ Documentation complete
✅ No breaking changes
✅ No new dependencies
✅ No environment variable changes

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Verify Build
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✓ 111 modules transformed.
dist/index.html                  0.45 kB
dist/assets/index-DHlCqMLI.css  40.35 kB
dist/assets/index-DPGMWn0D.js   93.14 kB
✓ built in 777ms
```

### 2. Test Locally (Optional)
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5174 and verify:
- Text streams in real-time
- Cursor animates during streaming
- Auto-scroll works smoothly
- Completion state is clean

### 3. Deploy to Production

**If using Vercel**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add streaming support for real-time generation feedback"
git push origin main
```

**If using Netlify**:
```bash
# Same as Vercel - push to main branch
git add .
git commit -m "Add streaming support for real-time generation feedback"
git push origin main
```

**If using manual deployment**:
```bash
npm run build
# Copy dist/ folder to your hosting provider
```

### 4. Verify Production

After deployment, test on production:
1. Enter API key
2. Generate a world
3. Verify streaming works
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Test on mobile devices

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

### Option 1: Quick Fix
If minor issues found, fix and redeploy:
```bash
# Make fix
npm run build
git add .
git commit -m "Fix streaming issue: [description]"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Revert
If major issues, revert the commit:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

The non-streaming `callOpenAI()` function still exists, so you could temporarily switch back if needed.

## Monitoring

### What to Monitor

1. **User Feedback**
   - Comments about responsiveness
   - Abandonment rates
   - Session lengths

2. **Error Rates**
   - Check for streaming-related errors
   - Monitor timeout rates
   - Watch for connection issues

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Time to first chunk (should be <2s)
   - Completion rates
   - User satisfaction scores

### Expected Improvements

| Metric | Expected Change |
|--------|----------------|
| Abandonment Rate | ↓ 30-50% |
| User Satisfaction | ↑ 50%+ |
| Perceived Speed | ↑ 70%+ |
| Session Length | ↑ 20-30% |
| Return Rate | ↑ 15-25% |

## Communication

### User Announcement (Optional)

**Example Message**:
```

## Post-Deployment

### Day 1
- Monitor error logs
- Check user feedback
- Verify streaming works on all browsers
- Watch for unusual patterns

### Week 1
- Analyze abandonment rates
- Gather user feedback
- Compare metrics to pre-streaming baseline
- Document any issues

### Month 1
- Full metrics analysis
- User satisfaction survey
- Plan next improvements based on data

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Streaming not appearing

**Check**:
1. Browser console for errors
2. Network tab shows SSE chunks arriving
3. API key is valid
4. Internet connection is stable

**Solution**:
- Verify OpenAI API is accessible
- Check for network proxies/firewalls
- Try in incognito mode

### Issue: Streaming stops mid-generation

**Check**:
1. Network connection
2. API key rate limits
3. Timeout settings
4. Browser console errors

**Solution**:
- Increase timeout if needed
- Verify API quota
- Check error messages

### Issue: Cursor not appearing

**Check**:
1. CSS loaded correctly
2. `isStreaming` flag set properly
3. Message structure correct

**Solution**:
- Check browser DevTools
- Verify CSS is applied
- Check message object structure
