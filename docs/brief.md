# Project Brief: AI Adventure Engine

---

## Executive Summary

**AI Adventure Engine** is a web-based interactive text adventure game that uses AI to generate completely unique worlds, stories, and characters for every playthrough. Unlike traditional text adventures with pre-written narratives, this game leverages user-provided AI API keys to dynamically create rich fantasy, cyberpunk, or steampunk worlds that deliver D&D-depth storytelling without mechanical complexity. The MVP will prove that AI can reliably generate engaging, coherent narrative experiences across multiple themes, making every gaming session a fresh journey of discovery.

**Primary Problem:** Text adventure games suffer from limited replay value - once you've experienced the story, there's little reason to play again. Players crave the depth and variety of tabletop RPGs but want the accessibility of digital text adventures.

**Target Market:** Casual to dedicated gamers who enjoy narrative-driven experiences, creative writing enthusiasts, and fans of D&D/tabletop RPGs seeking solo digital adventures.

**Key Value Proposition:** Every playthrough is a completely unique story in an original world you've never seen before - infinite replay value through AI-powered generation.

---

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
Traditional text adventure games are limited by their pre-written content. Once players complete a story, replay value drops to near zero unless they want to explore different choice branches. Even games with branching narratives eventually exhaust their content, and creating enough variety to maintain engagement requires massive development resources.

**Pain Points:**
- **Limited Replayability:** After 1-3 playthroughs, players have seen all the core content
- **Development Bottleneck:** Creating rich, branching narratives is time-intensive and expensive
- **Lack of Personalization:** Every player experiences essentially the same worlds and characters
- **Accessibility Gap:** Tabletop RPGs offer infinite variety through human game masters, but require coordination, time commitment, and other players

**Impact:**
Players who love narrative games are constantly seeking new content, but the industry can't produce quality stories fast enough to satisfy demand. This creates a cycle where players consume content faster than developers can create it, leading to player churn and limited engagement windows.

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- Procedural generation in games typically creates shallow, repetitive experiences lacking narrative coherence
- AI chatbots can tell stories but lack game structure, pacing, and meaningful choices
- Tabletop RPGs offer depth but require significant time, coordination, and often other players

**Urgency:**
AI language models have reached a capability threshold where they can generate coherent, engaging narratives. This is a narrow window to establish a foothold in AI-powered gaming before the market becomes saturated. Building now allows us to learn what works and iterate while the space is still relatively open.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept:**
AI Adventure Engine is a web application where users input their own AI API key, select a theme (Fantasy, Cyberpunk, or Steampunk for MVP), and click "Start Adventure." The AI generates a completely unique world with its own geography, cultures, conflicts, and magic/technology systems. As the player makes choices, the AI continues the narrative, maintaining coherence while ensuring each decision meaningfully impacts the story.

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **True Uniqueness:** Not just branching narratives or templates - every world, character, and plot is generated from scratch
2. **D&D Depth, Text Adventure Simplicity:** Rich world-building and storytelling without character sheets, stats, or complex mechanics
3. **User-Owned AI:** Players provide their own API keys, eliminating our infrastructure costs and giving users control over quality/cost tradeoffs
4. **Multi-Genre from Launch:** Three distinct themes (Fantasy, Cyberpunk, Steampunk) prove the system's flexibility

**Why This Will Succeed:**
- **AI as Game Master:** We're essentially giving every player their own AI dungeon master that never runs out of ideas
- **Infinite Content:** The replay value is theoretically infinite - players can experience hundreds of unique adventures
- **Low Development Overhead:** Once the prompt engineering and UI are built, adding new themes is primarily about prompt templates, not content creation
- **Proven AI Capability:** Modern LLMs (GPT-4, Claude) have demonstrated strong creative writing and coherence maintenance

**High-Level Vision:**
A platform where players can experience endless narrative adventures across any genre imaginable, with AI handling world creation, NPC interactions, and story progression. Think of it as "Netflix for text adventures" - but every show is created uniquely for you in real-time.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

- **User API Key Management:** Simple, secure input for users to provide their OpenAI API key. Clear instructions and error handling for invalid keys.
  - *Rationale: This is the foundational requirement - without API access, the game cannot function. User-provided keys also eliminate our infrastructure costs.*

- **Theme Selection:** Three distinct themes (Fantasy, Cyberpunk, Steampunk) with clear visual/textual differentiation.
  - *Rationale: Multiple themes prove the system's flexibility and give users immediate variety, addressing the core value proposition.*

- **AI World Generation:** On "New Game," AI generates a unique world including setting, cultures, conflicts, and rules (magic systems, technology, etc.).
  - *Rationale: This is the core differentiator - truly unique worlds each playthrough, not just story variations.*

- **Narrative Progression System:** Display AI-generated story text and present player with 2-4 meaningful choices at decision points.
  - *Rationale: The fundamental gameplay loop - read, choose, see consequences, repeat.*

- **Story Coherence Maintenance:** AI maintains consistency across 10-20 interactions, remembering earlier choices and world details.
  - *Rationale: Without coherence, the experience falls apart. This is the technical challenge that proves viability.*

- **Basic Web Interface:** Clean, readable UI for story display, choice selection, and theme/game management. Mobile-responsive.
  - *Rationale: Accessibility across devices is essential. Fancy graphics aren't needed, but clarity and usability are critical.*

### Out of Scope for MVP

- Save/load game functionality (single-session adventures only)
- User accounts or authentication
- Theme variants (e.g., "Dark Fantasy" vs "Humorous Fantasy")
- Unique player role system (castle spirit, dragon's shadow, etc.)
- Additional themes beyond Fantasy, Cyberpunk, Steampunk
- Story sharing or community features
- Advanced customization (tone adjustment, pacing preferences)
- Local AI model support (Ollama, LM Studio)
- Multiple AI provider support (only OpenAI for MVP)

### MVP Success Criteria

**The MVP is successful if:**

1. **Technical Proof:** Users can complete 10+ unique adventures without critical failures, and each feels genuinely different
2. **Engagement Validation:** 30%+ of users complete 3+ adventures, indicating the core loop is compelling
3. **Quality Threshold:** User feedback indicates narratives are coherent, interesting, and worth the API costs
4. **Learning Achieved:** We understand what prompt engineering strategies work, what fails, and how to improve post-MVP

- **Browser/OS Support:**
  - Modern browsers: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
  - Mobile: iOS Safari 14+, Android Chrome 90+
  - No IE11 support required
- **Performance Requirements:**
  - Page load: <3 seconds on 4G connection
  - AI response time: 5-15 seconds acceptable (user feedback during generation)
  - Minimal bandwidth: <1MB for app, API calls vary by provider

### Technology Preferences

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML/CSS/JavaScript (vanilla or lightweight framework like Vue.js/Svelte)
  - Consider: React if team has existing expertise, but avoid overengineering
  - Tailwind CSS or similar for rapid UI development

- **Backend:**
  - Minimal backend initially (could be serverless/edge functions if needed)
  - Primary logic runs client-side with direct API calls to OpenAI
  - Node.js/Express or Cloudflare Workers if backend routing needed

- **Database:**
  - Not required for MVP (no save system, no user accounts)
  - Post-MVP: PostgreSQL or Firebase for user data and saved games

- **Hosting/Infrastructure:**
  - Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages for static site hosting (free tier sufficient for MVP)
  - CDN for global performance
  - No server costs initially since users provide API keys

### Architecture Considerations

- **Repository Structure:**
  - Monorepo with `/frontend` and `/docs` initially
  - Add `/backend` when save system or user accounts needed

- **Service Architecture:**
  - Client-side single-page application (SPA)
  - Direct API calls from browser to OpenAI (CORS permitting, or proxy through edge functions)
  - Stateless design for MVP (no server-side session management)

- **Integration Requirements:**
  - OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-turbo for MVP, GPT-4 support for users who want higher quality)
  - Future: Anthropic Claude API, local model APIs (Ollama)

- **Security/Compliance:**
  - Secure API key storage (browser local storage with encryption, or session-only memory)
  - No API keys sent to our servers (client-side direct to OpenAI)
  - HTTPS required for all traffic
  - Clear privacy policy: we don't store user data or API keys
  - Rate limiting/cost warnings to prevent accidental API overuse

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Budget:** $0-100 for MVP (free hosting, user-provided API keys, open-source tools only)
  - *Post-MVP may require $20-50/month for database hosting if implementing save system*

- **Timeline:** 6-8 weeks to functional MVP (1-2 weeks prompt engineering, 1-2 weeks UI, 2-3 weeks integration/testing, 1 week polish)
  - *Solo developer assumed; timeline compresses with team*

- **Resources:** Solo developer project (fun/learning focused, not commercial initially)
  - *Technical skills required: JavaScript, API integration, basic prompt engineering*

- **Technical:**
  - Dependent on OpenAI API availability and reliability
  - AI quality limits - can't guarantee perfect narrative every time
  - User must have valid API key and understand associated costs
  - Browser-only for MVP (no native apps or offline support)

### Key Assumptions

- Users are comfortable obtaining and using OpenAI API keys (or we can provide clear instructions)
- OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo is capable enough for engaging narratives (early testing will validate)
- Players prefer unique worlds over recurring worlds with unique stories
- 20-40 minute adventure sessions are the right length (not too short, not exhausting)
- Web interface is sufficient - native apps aren't needed for MVP
- Prompt engineering can achieve consistent quality across themes
- Users will accept 5-15 second AI response times as reasonable
- The "fun to build" motivation will sustain development through challenges

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **AI Coherence Failure:** AI may lose track of earlier story elements, breaking immersion and player trust
  - *Mitigation: Extensive prompt engineering testing, context management strategies, fallback to simpler narratives if coherence degrades*

- **API Cost Shock:** Users may be surprised by API costs after extended play, leading to negative perception
  - *Mitigation: Prominent cost warnings, usage estimates, recommendations for GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4*

- **Repetitive Output:** AI might generate similar worlds/stories despite uniqueness goal, reducing replay value
  - *Mitigation: Test across 50+ generations, implement "seed" variations, refine prompts to encourage diversity*

- **OpenAI API Outages:** Dependency on single provider means service unavailability breaks the entire game
  - *Mitigation: Clear error messaging, graceful degradation, post-MVP multi-provider support*

- **Prompt Injection/Manipulation:** Users might try to "break" the AI or generate inappropriate content
  - *Mitigation: System prompts with guardrails, content filtering, clear terms of use*

### Open Questions

- How many AI interactions constitute a satisfying "complete" playthrough? (10? 20? 50? Player decides?)
- Should there be explicit win/lose states, or pure narrative exploration with player-determined endpoints?
- What's the optimal balance between AI creativity and narrative structure/pacing?
- How do we handle edge cases where AI generates plot holes or contradictions?
- Should players be able to "rewind" choices, or are all decisions permanent?
- What's the user onboarding flow for those unfamiliar with API keys?
- How do we balance prompt complexity (better results) vs API costs (simpler prompts are cheaper)?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- **AI coherence strategies:** Testing conversation history vs. world state summaries vs. other memory techniques
- **Prompt optimization:** Finding the minimum prompt complexity that achieves quality results (cost efficiency)
- **Choice quality design:** What makes choices feel meaningful vs superficial in AI-generated narratives?
- **Theme prompt templates:** Developing the formula for reliable theme differentiation
- **User testing:** Early prototype testing to validate uniqueness perception and engagement
- **Competitive analysis:** Review similar AI storytelling tools (AI Dungeon, NovelAI) to identify gaps and opportunities
