# Project Brief: AI Worldbuilding Assistant

**Version:** 3.0
**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Status:** Active

---

## Executive Summary

An AI-powered conversational assistant specialized in worldbuilding for authors and creative hobbyists. Unlike general-purpose AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude), this assistant is purpose-built to help users brainstorm, create, and expand fictional worlds through natural conversation. Users bring their own OpenAI API keys and collaborate with an AI that understands worldbuilding principles, consistency, and creative development.

**Primary Problem:** Worldbuilding is difficult and time-consuming. General LLMs like ChatGPT provide generic responses that lack worldbuilding expertise. Authors need a specialized tool that understands narrative consistency, world development, and creative iteration.

**Target Market:** Authors (fantasy, sci-fi, fiction), worldbuilding hobbyists, game designers, and creative writers who need help developing fictional settings.

**Key Value Proposition:** A conversational AI assistant that specializes in worldbuilding - helping you brainstorm ideas, generate complete worlds, and iteratively refine them through natural dialogue.

## Problem Statement

### Current State

Authors and worldbuilding enthusiasts face several challenges:

**Pain Points:**
1. **Blank Page Syndrome:** Starting a new world from scratch is overwhelming
2. **Lack of Inspiration:** Getting stuck on world details with no ideas
3. **General AI Limitations:** ChatGPT gives generic fantasy tropes without depth or originality
4. **Inconsistency:** Building complex worlds manually leads to contradictions
5. **No Specialized Guidance:** Generic AI doesn't understand worldbuilding best practices
6. **Iteration Difficulty:** Hard to refine and expand worlds without losing coherence

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**ChatGPT / Claude (General AI):**
- Generic responses full of clichés
- No specialized worldbuilding knowledge
- Doesn't maintain world context well
- No guidance on worldbuilding principles
- Forgets details from earlier in conversation

**Manual Worldbuilding:**
- Extremely time-consuming
- Easy to get stuck or blocked
- Hard to maintain consistency
- Limited by personal creativity bandwidth

**Template-Based Tools (World Anvil, Campfire):**
- Require all content to be written manually
- Provide organization, not creative assistance
- No AI generation capabilities

**Random Generators:**
- Generate disconnected elements
- No coherence or narrative logic
- Shallow results without depth

### The Gap

No tool combines:
- Conversational AI assistance
- Specialized worldbuilding expertise
- Context-aware iteration and refinement
- User-controlled (own API keys, no subscription)

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept

A web-based conversational interface where users chat with an AI assistant that specializes in worldbuilding. The assistant:

- **Understands Worldbuilding:** Trained prompts focus on narrative consistency, originality, and creative depth
- **Collaborates Naturally:** Users can brainstorm, iterate, and refine through conversation
- **Maintains Context:** Remembers everything about the world being developed
- **Provides Expertise:** Suggests improvements, catches inconsistencies, adds depth
- **Adapts to User Needs:** Works with partial ideas or generates complete worlds from scratch

### How It Works

**1. Setup:**
- User enters OpenAI API key
- Chat interface opens (like ChatGPT but specialized)

**2. Worldbuilding Conversations:**

Users can:
- **Brainstorm:** "I need ideas for a fantasy world with unique magic"
- **Generate:** "Create a complete world with 3 cultures and a magic system"
- **Iterate:** "Change the magic system to be more scientific"
- **Expand:** "Tell me more about the mountain culture's daily life"
- **Question:** "What would happen if these two cultures went to war?"
- **Refine:** "Make the world darker and more political"

**3. AI Assistant Behavior:**
- Asks clarifying questions when needed
- Suggests creative directions
- Maintains consistency with established details
- Provides worldbuilding guidance
- Generates content in conversational or structured formats
- Remembers everything from the conversation

**4. Export & Save:**
- Download conversation history
- Export world as structured document (JSON/Markdown)
- Save chat sessions for later

### Key Differentiators

1. **Specialized, Not General:** Built for worldbuilding, not general chat
2. **Conversational:** Natural dialogue, not button-driven workflows
3. **Iterative:** Refine and improve through conversation
4. **Context-Aware:** Maintains world consistency automatically
5. **Flexible:** Works with your ideas or generates from scratch
6. **User-Owned:** Bring your own API key, no subscription
