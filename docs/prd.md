**Version:** 1.1
**Status:** Draft
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-11

---

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Deliver infinite replay value through AI-powered unique world generation for every playthrough
- Provide D&D-depth storytelling without mechanical complexity (no stats, dice, character sheets)
- Support multiple genres from launch (Fantasy, Cyberpunk, Steampunk) to prove system flexibility
- Enable users to own their AI experience through user-provided API keys (zero infrastructure costs)
- Launch functional MVP within 6-8 weeks with core gameplay loop working
- Achieve 90%+ technical reliability (game sessions complete without critical AI failures)
- Maintain 30%+ user engagement (complete at least 3 unique playthroughs within first week)

### Background Context

Traditional text adventure games suffer from limited replay value due to pre-written content. Once players complete a story, there's little reason to return unless exploring different choice branches. Even games with branching narratives eventually exhaust their content, and creating enough variety requires massive development resources. Players who love narrative games consume content faster than developers can produce it, leading to player churn and limited engagement.

AI language models have reached a capability threshold where they can generate coherent, engaging narratives. AI Adventure Engine leverages this by acting as a personal AI dungeon master for every player, generating completely unique worlds, characters, and plots for each playthrough. This isn't just branching narratives or templates - it's true procedural storytelling that maintains D&D-level depth while keeping text adventure simplicity. By having users provide their own API keys, the platform eliminates infrastructure costs and gives players control over quality/cost tradeoffs.

**Competitive Landscape:**

The text adventure and AI storytelling space has several established players, but each has limitations that AI Adventure Engine addresses:

- **AI Dungeon:** The most prominent AI-powered text adventure, but uses shared/template worlds rather than generating completely unique worlds per playthrough. Quality can be inconsistent, and the subscription model adds friction.
- **NovelAI:** Excellent AI storytelling with customization options, but focused on novel writing and creative writing rather than structured interactive adventures with meaningful choices.
- **Traditional Text Adventures (Twine, Choice of Games):** High-quality, well-crafted narratives but suffer from fixed content. Once you've played through, replay value is limited to exploring different branches of the same story.
- **Tabletop RPGs (D&D, etc.):** Offer infinite variety through human game masters, but require scheduling, other players, and significant time commitment.

**Market Gap:** No current product combines AI-generated completely unique worlds (not just stories) with structured adventure gameplay that maintains coherence across extended sessions. AI Adventure Engine fills this gap by generating original worlds, cultures, and conflicts for every playthrough while maintaining the accessibility and simplicity of digital text adventures.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Create a clean, distraction-free reading experience that prioritizes narrative immersion over visual complexity. The interface should feel like a modern digital book combined with a choose-your-own-adventure format - elegant typography, generous whitespace, and smooth transitions between story beats. Players should feel transported into their AI-generated worlds without UI elements breaking immersion. The design should be simple enough that first-time users can start playing within 5 minutes of landing on the site, with minimal onboarding friction.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Single-path progression:** Players read narrative text, select one choice from presented options, and continue forward linearly through the story
- **No complex inputs:** All interactions are button/tap-based choice selections - no text input for commands (unlike classic parser-based adventures)
- **Clear state indication:** Always clear what's story text vs. choices, what's already been read, and where the player is in the narrative flow
- **Immediate feedback:** Choices trigger immediate AI continuation with loading state, maintaining narrative momentum
- **Mobile-first gestures:** Tap to select choices, swipe/scroll to review previous narrative sections

### Core Screens and Views

1. **Landing/Welcome Screen** - Introduction to the concept, API key input, "How it works" brief explanation
2. **Theme Selection Screen** - Choose Fantasy, Cyberpunk, or Steampunk with thematic visual differentiation
3. **Story Display Screen (Main Gameplay)** - Narrative text display area + choice buttons + minimal UI chrome
4. **Settings/API Management Screen** - View/edit API key, cost estimates/warnings, basic preferences
5. **Adventure Complete Screen** - Summary/conclusion with option to start new adventure or change theme

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

**Target Level:** WCAG AA compliance for broad accessibility without the additional complexity of AAA requirements.

**Key considerations:**
- Sufficient color contrast for text readability
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactions
- Screen reader compatibility for narrative text and choices
- Scalable text sizing for vision accessibility
- Focus indicators for interactive elements

### Branding

**Minimal thematic branding for MVP:**
- Each theme (Fantasy, Cyberpunk, Steampunk) has subtle visual styling (color palette, typography hints) to reinforce genre immersion
- Clean, modern aesthetic that doesn't compete with narrative content
- No heavy illustration or artwork - let the AI-generated text create the imagery
- Possible light ambient effects (subtle background textures or gradients) that shift per theme

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

**Primary:** Modern web browsers on desktop and mobile devices
- Desktop: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+ (1920x1080 typical)
- Mobile: iOS Safari 14+, Android Chrome 90+ (375x667 to 414x896 typical)
- Tablet: Responsive design scales gracefully for iPad and Android tablets

**Responsive approach:** Single codebase with mobile-first design that scales up to desktop rather than separate mobile/desktop implementations.

**Out of scope for MVP:** Native iOS/Android apps, offline support, IE11, outdated browsers.

---

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

**Decision:** Single repository containing frontend code and documentation.

**Structure:**
```
/textgamea
  /frontend        # Web application code
  /docs           # PRD, architecture, stories
  .bmad-core/     # BMAD framework
  .claude/        # Claude Code commands
```

**Rationale:** Simple for solo developer - all code in one place, easy coordination, no multi-repo complexity.

---

### Service Architecture

**Decision:** Client-side Single Page Application (SPA) with optional serverless/edge functions for API proxying only if needed.

**Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** Browser-based JavaScript application handling all UI and game logic
- **API Layer:** Direct calls from browser to OpenAI API (add Cloudflare Workers/Vercel Edge Functions proxy only if CORS blocks direct calls)
- **State Management:** Client-side only, session-based (no server-side state)
- **Deployment:** Static site hosting (Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare Pages free tier)

**Technologies:**
- **Frontend Framework:** **Svelte (if learning new framework) OR framework you have 6+ months experience with**
  - Svelte: Minimal boilerplate, compiled framework, fastest time-to-value for new learners
  - Vue 3: Excellent choice if you have existing experience
  - React: Only if you already know it well (don't learn for this project)
  - Vanilla JS: Avoid - manual state management will cost 1+ weeks

- **CSS Framework:** **Tailwind CSS** (rapid UI development, saves 1-2 weeks vs custom CSS)
- **Build Tool:** **Vite** (fast, modern, minimal configuration)
- **Language:** **TypeScript IF you have TS experience, otherwise JavaScript**
  - TypeScript provides safety for handling unpredictable AI responses
  - If you've never used TypeScript, stick with JavaScript to save 5-7 days
- **API Integration:** Native fetch API (simple, no dependencies needed)

**Rationale:** Eliminates backend complexity (saves 1-2 weeks), uses free hosting, focuses development time on prompt engineering (the actual hard problem).

---

### Testing Requirements

**Decision:** Unit testing for critical paths only + extensive manual testing for narrative quality.

**Testing Strategy:**
- **Unit Tests:** API integration, error handling, game state management ONLY
- **Test Coverage Target:** **40-50%** (realistic for solo dev with tight timeline)
- **Integration Tests:** Not required for MVP
- **E2E Tests:** Manual only for MVP; automated post-launch if needed
- **Manual Testing:** **EXTENSIVE** for AI narrative quality (coherence, engagement, uniqueness)
  - This cannot be automated and is more important than code coverage
  - Budget 1-2 weeks for thorough manual testing across themes
- **User Testing:** 5-10 beta testers for validation before wider release

**Testing Tools:**
- **Unit Testing:** Vitest (works seamlessly with Vite) or Jest
- **Manual Testing:** Test scripts to rapidly try prompt variations and world generation

**Rationale:** Solo developer timeline demands focus on highest-value testing. AI narrative quality is the product's core value - must be tested manually by humans.

---

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Theme Launch Strategy (REVISED):**
- **Required for Launch:** Fantasy theme (fully polished, 15+ interaction coherence)
- **Stretch Goals:** Cyberpunk + Steampunk (launch if time permits)
- **Rationale:** One excellent theme proves concept better than three mediocre ones. Fantasy is most familiar to developer, so it's fastest to perfect.
- **Post-MVP:** Easy to add new themes once prompt engineering patterns are proven

**Prompt Engineering Timeline (REVISED):**
- **Allocation:** 2-3 weeks (50% of total MVP timeline)
- **Focus:** Start with Fantasy theme until coherence is proven across 15+ interactions
- **Quality Bar:** Stories must feel genuinely unique, maintain coherence, offer meaningful choices
- **Don't Proceed to UI Until:** At least one theme consistently generates engaging narratives
- **Rationale:** Prompt engineering is the core innovation and highest risk. Rushing it kills the MVP.

**API & Integration:**
- **AI Provider:** OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-turbo required, GPT-4 optional for users)
- **API Client:** Native fetch API (no axios dependency needed - simpler)
- **API Key Storage:** Browser localStorage (persists across sessions) with base64 encoding (light obfuscation)
- **Rate Limiting:** Client-side usage counter with prominent cost warnings every 5 interactions
- **CORS Handling:** Test direct browser → OpenAI first; add edge function proxy only if blocked

**Hosting & Deployment:**
- **Hosting Platform:** Vercel (preferred - excellent DX, edge functions if needed) or Netlify
- **Domain:** Free subdomain for MVP (e.g., ai-adventure-engine.vercel.app)
- **SSL/HTTPS:** Automatic via hosting platform (required for localStorage security)
- **CI/CD:** Git push to main branch triggers automatic deployment

**Security & Privacy:**
- API keys never sent to application servers (only client → OpenAI)
- No user data collection or storage (privacy by design - no analytics for MVP)
- Clear privacy statement: "Your API keys and stories never leave your browser"
- Optional: OpenAI moderation API to filter inappropriate content (add only if needed)

**Performance Targets:**
- Page load: <3 seconds on 4G mobile
- JavaScript bundle: <200KB initial load
- AI response time: 5-15 seconds (display loading state with estimated time)
- Lazy loading: Load theme styling only when selected

**Development Workflow:**
- **Version Control:** Git with GitHub
- **Branching Strategy:** main + feature branches (simple, no complex GitFlow)
- **Code Quality:** ESLint + Prettier for consistent formatting
- **Prompt Templates:** Separate YAML/JSON files from code for easy iteration without code changes
- **Documentation:** Inline code comments for complex prompt logic; architecture doc for high-level decisions

**Data Requirements:**

The MVP has minimal data storage needs, focusing on session-based gameplay without persistence:

- **API Key Storage:**
  - Type: String (OpenAI API key format: `sk-...`)
  - Storage: Browser localStorage with key `ai_adventure_api_key`
  - Encoding: Base64 encoded for light obfuscation
  - Lifetime: Persists across browser sessions until user clears
  - Security: Never transmitted to application servers

- **Game State (In-Memory Only):**
  - `worldContext`: String (300-500 words) - AI-generated world description used for narrative context
  - `narrativeBeats`: Array of strings - History of story segments for player review
  - `currentChoices`: Array of choice objects `{id, text}` - Active choices presented to player
  - `choiceHistory`: Array of strings - Record of player decisions for context management
  - `interactionCount`: Integer - Track adventure length
  - `sessionCost`: Float - Accumulated API costs in dollars
  - `tokenUsage`: Object `{input, output}` - Track token consumption per session
  - Lifetime: Session only - cleared when adventure ends or browser closes
  - Storage: JavaScript application state (framework-specific: Svelte store, Vue reactive, React state)

- **Settings/Preferences (Optional):**
  - `costWarningsEnabled`: Boolean - User preference for cost warnings
  - Storage: localStorage (persists across sessions)
  - Lifetime: Until user clears or changes setting

- **No Database Required:**
  - MVP is explicitly session-only (no save/load functionality)
  - No user accounts or authentication
  - No server-side data storage
  - All data lives in browser memory or localStorage

- **Data Flow:**
  1. User inputs API key → validated → saved to localStorage
  2. User starts adventure → game state initialized in memory
  3. AI generates content → added to game state arrays
  4. User makes choice → stored in choiceHistory → sent to AI for next beat
  5. Session ends → game state discarded (localStorage API key persists)

**Constraints from Brief:**
- $0-100 total MVP budget (all free/open-source tools)
- **6-8 weeks development timeline** (145-180 hours total)
- Solo developer (optimize for simplicity and maintainability over "best practices")
- Web-only for MVP (no native apps, no offline support, no IE11)

---

### Critical Path & Risk Mitigation

**Development Sequence (Non-Negotiable Order):**
1. **Weeks 1-3:** Prompt engineering (Fantasy first, then others if time allows)
2. **Weeks 3-4:** UI development (only after prompts are working)
3. **Week 5:** Integration (connect UI to OpenAI with error handling)
4. **Week 6:** Manual testing & prompt refinement
5. **Week 7:** Polish (mobile responsive, cost warnings, edge cases)
6. **Week 8:** Beta testing with 5-10 users, critical bug fixes

**Scope Protection Rules:**
- If it's not in FR1-FR10, it doesn't exist for MVP (no exceptions)
- No save/load system (adds 1-2 weeks + requires database)
- No user accounts (adds 1-2 weeks + backend complexity)
- No story sharing (adds 1+ week + community features)
- No theme variants (Terry Pratchett style, etc.) - post-MVP only
- No multi-AI provider support - OpenAI only for MVP

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Start prompt engineering on Day 1 (highest risk, longest timeline)
- Don't begin UI until at least one theme works well
- Be willing to launch with Fantasy only if timeline slips
- Use technologies you already know (only learn ONE new thing max)
- Manual testing cannot be rushed - budget full 1-2 weeks
