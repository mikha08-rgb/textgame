        - heading "Core Theme" [level=2] [ref=e30]
        - paragraph [ref=e31]: In Kabrithean Tides, memories are mechanized by heat — imbued in crystalline formations known as Kabrite, which store thermal imprints of significant events when exposed to temperatures exceeding 180°C for at least five minutes. These are physically crystallized, forming Memory Shards that vary in hue based on emotional intensity, ranging from pale blue for contentment to harsh red for anger. This crystallization process happens predominantly in the mining regions of Taenor Sands and is central to both personal and communal memory-keeping practices. The heat-memory exchange is so integral that legal systems like the Hearth Council in Ferran Summit use Memory Shards as irrefutable evidence in trials, their authenticity verified by Resonance Seekers who measure vibrational harmonics unique to individual shards. The presence of these shards affects all, from architecture that adapts to clandestinely stored memories, to the relationship of people with their environment, shaping their very interaction with the earth they tread upon.

        - heading "Geography" [level=2] [ref=e33]
        - paragraph [ref=e34]: "Kabrithean Tides is a land of diverse climates shaped by its core law, featuring three primary regions: the Taenor Sands with its blistering heat and abundant Kabrite deposits; the cool, mist-laden Vell Thickets where Memory Fogs form, enveloping forgotten pasts in yellow haze; and the crystalline alpine heights of Ferran Summit where memory heat is trapped by cold winds. Taenor Sands houses relentless heat, crucial for Kabrite activation but dangerous as intense thermal fluctuations can alter existing memories or crystalize new ones unintentionally. Vell Thickets, conversely, is a source of Dream Dew, a rare liquid traded for its memory-dampening effects. Meanwhile, at Ferran Summit, Memory Caches are etched into cliff-sides, serving as historical records visible for leagues."

            - heading "Fundamentals" [level=3] [ref=e68]
            - paragraph [ref=e69]: At the heart of Thermal Resonance lies the careful application of controlled heat to interact with Kabrite. Practitioners, known as Heat Singers, use specialized rods imbued with metallic filaments tuned to specific harmonic frequencies. To activate a memory shard, a practitioner holds the rod close to a Kabrite sample for exactly 236 seconds, inducing a resonant state that reveals or alters existing memories. The process is risky, as misalignment by merely 5 degrees can disastrously fragment or forge false memories, inflicting insanity or violent discord upon the subjects. Students learn through a stringent seven-year apprenticeship, mastering thermal control and harmonic alignment to avoid catastrophic errors.
