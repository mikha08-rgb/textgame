## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Missing UI Components
All 7 failed features share the same symptom: **expected buttons/inputs not found**. This suggests:

1. **Incomplete Implementation:** Features may exist in prompts/API layer but UI components were never built
2. **Routing/State Issues:** Components exist but aren't shown in correct app state
3. **Layout Issues:** Components render but are hidden/offscreen

### Secondary Issue: Quality (World Generation)
User feedback indicates the one working feature (world generation) produces "acceptable not good but acceptable" quality:
- Needs more detail
- Output quality could be improved
- Prompts may need refinement

## User Feedback Summary

> "buttons not working and other things do not gen high quality. some ui is unintuitive and i think a revamp is best plan. the first gen is pretty good but a bit more detail may be nice but everything else is not great."

Key insights:
- Buttons are broken (confirmed by tests)
- AI generation quality is low (for expansion features)
- UI/UX is unintuitive
- User recommends UI revamp

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Investigate App.svelte** - Check component structure and conditional rendering
2. **Verify Component Files** - Confirm all feature components exist in `/frontend/src/components/`
3. **Review State Management** - Check if features are gated behind state conditions
4. **UI/UX Redesign** - Per user request, consider full UI revamp
5. **Quality Improvements** - Refine prompts for better world generation
6. **Implement Missing Features** - Build out the 7 broken features

## Test Artifacts

- **Test File:** `/frontend/tests/feature-audit.spec.js`
- **Test Config:** `/frontend/playwright.config.js` (timeout increased to 240s for AI operations)
- **Test Results:** `/frontend/test-results/.last-run.json`

## Notes

- All tests marked as "passed" because test harness successfully ran (no errors)
- Actual feature functionality failures logged via console output (❌ markers)
- Tests are conservative - they check for element existence, not full functionality
- Manual testing still required to verify AI output quality
