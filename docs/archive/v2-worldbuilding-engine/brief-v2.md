# Project Brief: AI Worldbuilding Engine

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Status:** Active

---

## Executive Summary

**AI Worldbuilding Engine** is a web-based creative tool that uses AI to generate comprehensive, detailed fantasy worlds for writers, game designers, and worldbuilding hobbyists. Unlike traditional worldbuilding tools with templates or pre-set structures, this engine leverages user-provided OpenAI API keys to dynamically create unique worlds with rich cultures, magic systems, histories, and conflictsâ€”complete with the ability to expand any aspect through on-demand content generation.

**Primary Problem:** Writers and game designers need rich, coherent fantasy worlds but lack the time to develop them from scratch. Worldbuilding is time-intensive, and creative blocks can stall projects for weeks.

**Target Market:** Creative writers (fantasy/sci-fi), tabletop game designers (D&D, Pathfinder), video game designers, and worldbuilding enthusiasts who create worlds as a hobby.

**Key Value Proposition:** Generate a complete, detailed fantasy world in 2-3 minutes, then expand any aspect (characters, locations, legends, cultures) on-demand. Export everything as JSON or Markdown for use in your projects.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
Creative professionals and hobbyists building fantasy worlds face a significant time investment. Developing a coherent world with cultures, magic systems, geography, history, and conflicts can take weeks or months. This bottleneck delays writing projects, game development, and creative exploration.

**Pain Points:**
- **Time-Intensive Process:** Building a detailed world from scratch takes 20-60+ hours
- **Creative Blocks:** Writers get stuck on world details, stalling their main projects
- **Lack of Depth:** Quick worldbuilding often lacks the richness needed for immersive stories
- **Inconsistency:** Hand-crafted worlds risk internal contradictions across multiple documents
- **Limited Inspiration:** Traditional tools use templates, which feel generic and constrained

**Impact:**
Writers delay projects waiting for "the right world." Game designers spend development time on worldbuilding instead of gameplay. Hobbyists abandon projects due to creative burnout. The industry needs tools that accelerate worldbuilding without sacrificing depth or uniqueness.

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- Random generators create shallow, disconnected elements
- Templates feel generic and lack originality
- Manual worldbuilding is too time-consuming
- AI chatbots generate text but lack structure and export functionality

**Opportunity:**
AI language models can now generate coherent, detailed content across multiple domains (geography, culture, history). This technology enables rapid creation of rich, interconnected worlds that maintain internal consistency.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept:**
AI Worldbuilding Engine is a web application where users input their OpenAI API key, select a theme (Fantasy for MVP), and click "Generate World." Within 2-3 minutes, the AI creates a comprehensive world with:
- Core theme and unique feature
- Detailed geography with major locations
- Complete history (ancient to recent)
- Original magic system with rules and social impact
- Multiple cultures with values, economies, and relationships
- Central conflicts and rising tensions
- Economic systems and daily life details
- Hidden secrets for storytelling depth

Users can then **explore and expand** any aspect:
- Click a culture to generate detailed daily life, notable figures, and locations
- Generate characters with full backstories, goals, and secrets
- Create locations with inhabitants and situations
- Generate legends, myths, and historical events
- Ask freeform questions about the world
- Export everything as JSON or Markdown

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **Complete Worlds, Not Parts:** Generates interconnected systems (not isolated elements)
2. **Depth on Demand:** Start with overview, drill down into any aspect
3. **Export & Integration:** Download worlds for use in your projects (JSON/Markdown)
4. **User-Owned AI:** Users provide API keys (no subscription, pay-per-use)
5. **Structured Creativity:** Maintains coherence while generating unique content

**Primary Use Cases:**
- **Fantasy Writers:** Generate world for novel, expand cultures as story needs emerge
- **Game Designers:** Create campaign setting, generate NPCs and locations on-the-fly
- **Worldbuilding Hobbyists:** Explore "what if" scenarios, build worlds for fun
- **Creative Teams:** Collaborative worldbuilding with exportable, shareable results

- Generate complete world foundations quickly
- Expand world details as needed
- Export for integration with writing/design tools
- Maintain creative control and customization

**Quote:** *"I need a rich fantasy world for my novel, but worldbuilding takes months. I want to start writing the story, not spend another year on geography and culture docs."*

### Secondary Persona: Tabletop Game Master

**Demographics:**
- Age: 25-45

## Success Criteria

**MVP Success Metrics:**
- **Adoption:** 100+ users generate worlds in first month
- **Engagement:** 40%+ users expand at least one world aspect (culture/character/location)
- **Export:** 20%+ users export worlds (indicates real-world use)
- **Retention:** 30%+ users return to generate a second world
- **Technical:** <5% error rate, 95%+ successful world generations

**Long-term Vision:**
- Multi-theme support (Cyberpunk, Steampunk, Sci-Fi, Horror)
- Collaboration features (shared worlds, team editing)
- Integration with writing tools (Scrivener, Google Docs)
- Community sharing (publish worlds, remix others' creations)
- Advanced AI customization (control tone, complexity, originality)

---

## Technical Approach

**Architecture:** Client-side SPA (Single Page Application)
**Framework:** Svelte 5 + Vite 7
**Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
**AI Integration:** Direct OpenAI API calls (user-provided keys)
**Hosting:** Vercel (static site, zero backend)
**Storage:** Browser localStorage (client-side only)

**No Backend Required:**
- Users provide their own OpenAI API keys
- All data stays client-side (privacy + zero infrastructure cost)
- Static site deployment on free tier

---

## Competitive Landscape

**AI Dungeon / NovelAI:**
- Focus on narrative generation and interactive fiction
- Less structured worldbuilding tools
- Subscription-based (not user-owned AI)

**World Anvil / Campfire:**
- Manual worldbuilding with templates
- No AI generation
- Organization-focused, not content creation

**ChatGPT / Claude (direct use):**
- Powerful but unstructured
- No export or organization
- Requires manual prompting and context management

**Market Gap:** No tool combines structured AI worldbuilding + on-demand expansion + export functionality + user-owned AI.
